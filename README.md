# data-512-a1

The first assignment of DATA 512-MSDS: A1 Data Curation Assignment. 

### Goal
The aim of this project is to track the traffic trend of Wikipedia since 2008 by integrating and analyzing data through the use of the Wikipedia REST API, which includes desktop, mobile, and total views. In addition, this project demonstrates the data processing and analysis process in detail through Jupyter Notebook to ensure that the analysis process can be fully reproducible by others.

### API 
- The Legacy Pagecounts API ([documentation](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/AQS/Legacy_Pagecounts), [endpoint](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/#/Pagecounts_data_(legacy)/get_metrics_legacy_pagecounts_aggregate_project_access_site_granularity_start_end)) provides access to desktop and mobile traffic data from December 2007 through July 2016.
- The Pageviews API ([documentation](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/AQS/Pageviews), [endpoint](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/#/Pageviews_data/get_metrics_pageviews_aggregate_project_access_agent_granularity_start_end)) provides access to desktop, mobile web, and mobile app traffic data from July 2015 through last month.
